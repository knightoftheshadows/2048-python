Genetic NN 2048-python
===========

Te idea is to use a genetic algorithm to train neural networks to play this game called 2048. 

I finished coding it, however the neural network enters in a loophole which is very difficult to address. Probably it's necessary to make the network deeper and adjust parameters.

Recommendations and pull requests are welcome.

To start the algorithm, run:
    
    $ python3 genetic.py
